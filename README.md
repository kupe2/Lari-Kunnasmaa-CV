# Lari-Kunnasmaa-CV

Hi there,
Welcome to my page

My name is Lari Kunnasmaa and I am an Univesity student from Turku, soon moving to Pori.

I have majored in physics with a minor in mathematics, programming and sustainable development. 

When starting programming, I had no idea how much I would end up loving it. Turns out all I needed was the right motivation. After which I could not get enough of it, even coding in my free time. I have mostly used Python and especially pandas, and NumPy. Although I have used a bit of java and done some Arduino projects.  

This repository contains university projects relating to data analysis and physics. These projects include a part of the code for my Master's thesis, a simulation on diffusion. These projects are an example, so if you are interested feel free to ask me for other projects that I have worked on like Capstone(Pipeline, data analysis) or a projects done in a data analysis course or even a free time projects. In some branches there is also a pdf explaining about the project, I highly encourage looking at it espcially for the thesis on (or at least look at the funny pictures), since just the code wont be enough to understand what is going on in the project.
