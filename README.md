# Lari-Kunnasmaa-CV

This project is a part of the code that will be in my finished thesis. The code is commented on somewhat poorly since it is a work in progress and it is almost impossible to explain in comments what the code is doing without knowing more about PEPICO. The pdf should help understand some parts, but it might be hard to follow since it is very simplified. But not to worry there are at least some neat pictures that give some idea of what the code does. For those intestesed feel free to ask me for the rest of the code or more detaild explanation on it.
