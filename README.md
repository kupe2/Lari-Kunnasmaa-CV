# Lari-Kunnasmaa-CV

Hello, 

I see you stumpled in to my one of my free time RPA projects. The projects purpose is mostly to avoid carpal tunnel by automizing stuff, that you might not want to do manually.
I think these project is a great way for me show my problem solving skills and knowledge of applying pythons image recognition and click automation. In the following pdfs I go through the projects, by explaining their purpose. Not including the selenium and github I think the comments will be enough. I hope you enjoy. There is an automatic reply function written if you want to test it out feel free to send an email to "laricvreply@gmail.com". The reply code is shown so people who are rightfully scared of security risks can see it.
