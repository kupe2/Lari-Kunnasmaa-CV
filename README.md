# Lari-Kunnasmaa-CV

This project was done as the final project a part of a course where python was used to simulate physics phenomena and I got excellent marks on the course. The pdf shows the physics behind the simulation. (There are neat pictures at the end of the pdf, for people who might not be too interested in the physics part). The simulation should run with the right packages.
