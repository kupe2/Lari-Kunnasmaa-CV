# Lari-Kunnasmaa-CV

This project is a part of the code that will be in my finished thesis. The code is commented on somewhat poorly since it is a work in progress and it is almost impossible to explain in comments what the code is doing without knowing more about PEPICO. The pdf should help understand some parts, but it might be hard to follow since it is very simplified. But not to worry there are at least some neat pictures that give some idea of what the code does. I highly recommend looking at the example code since it is expalained in the pdf, but there is also, the full code used in the thesis for those interes,t thought it is still in progress.
